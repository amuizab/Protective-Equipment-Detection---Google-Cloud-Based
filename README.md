# Protective-Equipment-Detection-Google-Cloud-Based
Object Detection with Google Cloud environment, autoML, colab enterprise, and create an endpoint to predict and serve.

## Pipeline
- **Data Collection and Preparation**:
    - **Collect Images**: Gather images that include people with and without protective equipment (e.g., helmets, vests, gloves).
    - **Label Data**: Annotate images with bounding boxes identifying the protective equipment.
- **Data Storage**:
    - **Upload to Google Cloud Storage**: Store your labeled images in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
- **Create an AutoML Dataset**:
    - **Import Data**: Load your labeled images from Google Cloud Storage into Google Cloud AutoML Vision.
    - **Split Dataset**: AutoML automatically splits the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
- **Model Training**:
    - **Train the Model**: Use Google Cloud AutoML Vision to train a model on your dataset. AutoML will automatically optimize the model's hyperparameters.
    - **Monitor Training**: Monitor the training process in Google Cloud Console, reviewing metrics like accuracy and loss.
- **Model Evaluation**:
    - **Evaluate Performance**: AutoML provides evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess the modelâ€™s performance on the validation and test sets.
- **Model Deployment**:
    - **Deploy Model**: Deploy the trained model as an API on Google Cloud. This allows for real-time detection of protective equipment in images.
- **Real-Time Detection**:
    - **Input Images**: Upload images via API to detect protective equipment.
    - **Output Results**: The model returns the image with bounding boxes and labels indicating the detected protective equipment.
